# Mesa - a dapp for Gnosis Protocol

<img align="right" width="350" src="./docs/screenshot.png">

Mesa is the first dapp built on the [Gnosis Protocol](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol).

Gnosis Protocol is a fully permissionless DEX that enables ring trades to maximize liquidity.

Mesa allows users to:

- Create orders in [Gnosis Protocol](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol)
- See the balances for any token: available in their wallet and on the exchange
- Deposit and withdraw tokens to/from the exchange wallet

## Running locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (we use Yarn but NPM should work too)
yarn

# Start dev server in http://localhost:8080
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## Mock mode (default)

The app will run by default in **mock mode**, that means that all service implementations will be replaced by a mocked one with some fake data. This is useful for development, however it's also useful to run it with the actual implementation:

```bash
# Disable mock mode
MOCK=false yarn start
```

Alternatively, if you want to persist this behaviour, add the env var into a local `.env` file (i.e. use [.env.example](.env.example) as a template).

## Autoconnect for mock mode (default)

When running in **mock mode**, the wallet will be connected automatically - to change this behaviour run the app via:

```bash
# Disable autoconnect, for mock mode
AUTOCONNECT=false yarn start
```

Alternatively, if you want to persist this behaviour add the env var into a local `.env` file (i.e. use [.env.example](.env.example) as a template).

## Build app

```bash
yarn build
```

Static files will be generated inside the `./dist` dir.

## Run tests

```bash
yarn test
```

## Automatically fixing code

Manually, by running:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

If you use Visual Studio Code, it's recommended to install [Prettier - Code formatter
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and add the following to your `settings.json`

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll.eslint": true
}
```

## Testnet faucets

In order to get testing tokens, read up on the information here:
[faucet](./docs/faucet-info.md)

## Customizing components

This app employs overrides from an alternative source (`custom/` directory) for easy swap in of imported files.

Override works for absolute paths that make use of baseUrl
That is if there are two files:

```js
src/pages/About.tsx
custom/pages/About.tsx

import About from 'pages/About'
// will try resolving from custom/ first and failing that from src/
```

If you also need to change contents of `index.html`, you will have to modify `webpack.config.babel.js`:

```js
new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
  template: './src/html/index.html',
  title: ...
```

A good idea would be to conditionally change `template` path based on external config or an env variable.
