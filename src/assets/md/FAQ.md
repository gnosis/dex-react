**What is Mesa?**

Mesa is a decentralized application built on the **Gnosis Protocol**, a decentralized trading protocol for ERC-20s. Instead of using one order book per token pair, the Gnosis Protocol relies on batched auctions and a multidimensional orderbook. These mechanisms enable ring trades, in which liquidity amongst all assets tradable on the protocol is shared. Read more about the protocol’s mechanism on the Gnosis [DevPortal](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol/docs/introduction1/).

**How are trades matched?**

Orders are collected in batches every 5 minutes, and external participants called solvers (everyone can participate as a solver) propose a settlement solution to the smart contract. The smart contract selects the solution that maximizes [trader welfare](https://dfusion-docs.dev.gnosisdev.com/docs/devguide01/). The utility in this optimization function is the difference between what a trader is willing to pay and what they pay once a batch is cleared. After a solution is selected, orders are matched and settled accordingly and on-chain. 

**What advantages does this bring?**

- Liquidity shared amongst all token pairs - thanks to ring trades 
- Don't get front-run - thanks to batch actions
- Get a fairer price - thanks to uniform clearing prices

**Is Gnosis Protocol secure?**

The Gnosis Protocol smart contracts have been audited externally. Check this section on their [DevPortal](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol/docs/devguide04/) for further information, including the audit report and the code repository.

**Can I create a trade without depositing to the smart contract?**

Indeed, orders can be placed without a corresponding balance in the Exchange Wallet. However, **_only_** orders with a balance in the Exchange Wallet can be matched and filled.

**What is the Liquidity page?**

Liquidity provision is a way in which Mesa users can easily provide liquidity and get rewarded with little effort and low risk. It works by letting users place standing orders to market-make between selected tokens.

To provide liquidity, click on the `Liquidity` page, and follow three simple steps: select your stablecoin tokens, define your spread, and finally, submit your orders.

**Users must also have at least one of the tokens of their liquidity provision deposited in their Exchange Wallet to enable trades.**

Importantly, don’t forget that **all** orders placed by an Ethereum address share the same deposited liquidity! Consider participating with separate addresses for separate strategies when partaking in the liquidity provision and when trading normally.
